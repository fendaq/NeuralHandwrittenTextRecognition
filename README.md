<b>Neural Handwritten Text Recognition</b>

This repository contains experiments to recognize handwritten text with Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) + CTC and Seq2Seq with attention model architectures.

The dataset used is the <a href='http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-handwriting-database'>IAM Handwriting Database</a>.

The models are run for 20 epochs. The Seq2Seq model is run twice using the weights generated by the first run as initialization for the second run. This enhances the score of the model significantly. Alternatively one can only preload and fix the CNN weights to the same effect.

The notebooks IAM_SEQ_with_Line_Segmentation and IAM_CRNN_with_Line_Segmentation contain the logic to segment pages into lines using kraken https://github.com/mittagessen/kraken. Above deep learning models are applied to each line to recognize the text on the page.

And he intiated thathis Government would try trgt Germary to pary more . He did not mention perional talks with Dr. Adenauer , the West Germen Chancelor ."
